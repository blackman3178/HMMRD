## Project Description 
Tired of the same, old drink, add something new to a popular favorite to spice up your next event. This site allows you to update some of your favorite drinks by adding a little something new to surprise your taste buds. Have something you do different, let us know! Make your drink popular!


## User Story
As a person interested in cocktails, recipes and adding something different
I want to be able to interact with like minded individuals
So that I can understand otherâ€™s variations and opinions of popular drinks

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a cocktail API
When I visit the site
Then I am presented with a homepage that allows me to sign in as either a new user or returning user

Given my login credentials are accepted
When I click to enter the site on a secondary page
Then I am progressed to a page showing my user credential and status in the top navigation

Given I am in the secondary page that shows popular drinks
When I look to the side navigation bar that shows search results
Then I am presented with a search request to search the particular drink I am interested in

Given my search is successful
When I click search
Then I am presented ingredients, directions for making the drink and the list of comments from other users related to that specific drink.

Given that I want to add my own comments
When I click to add comments
Then I am presented with a way to add comments, suggest variations and save that information under the history related to that drink for others to view
